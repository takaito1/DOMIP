# Dissolved Oxygen Map Inter-comparison Project (DOMIP)

## experiment A
  - Common starting point is a monthly binned data from 1965 onwards.
  - The goal is to assemble decadal O2 climatology including five periods covering 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2010, and 2011-2020.
  - The first four decades can be based on shipboard observation (bottle and CTD)
  - The last decade (2011-2019) can include shipboard and Argo observation
  - The binned data is available from the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bdv-6nd4sWBaaGsWDTXJ_xO_hKI7Zi4y?usp=drive_link)
  - The source code for the binning is [here](https://github.com/takaito1/DOMIP/blob/main/bin_wod_bottle_v0.ipynb)
